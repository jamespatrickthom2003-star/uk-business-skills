## Part 1 — Statutory Calculations

### 1.1 Statutory Holiday Entitlement

**Legislation:** Working Time Regulations 1998 (as amended)

**Full-time workers:**
```
Minimum entitlement = 5.6 weeks per year = 28 days (including bank holidays)
```

**Part-time workers (fixed hours) — pro-rata:**
```
Annual entitlement = 5.6 x days worked per week
Example: 3 days/week = 5.6 x 3 = 16.8 days
```

**Irregular hours / part-year workers (ERA 2025 method):**
```
Holiday accrual = 12.07% of hours worked in the pay period
```

### 1.2 Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)

**2025/26 rate:** £116.75 per week

**Rules:**
```
Qualifying days       = days the employee normally works
Waiting days          = first 3 qualifying days (unpaid)
Payment starts        = 4th qualifying day
Maximum duration      = 28 weeks
Lower Earnings Limit  = £125 per week
```

### 1.3 Statutory Notice Periods

**Employer giving notice:**
```
1 month to 2 years    = 1 week
2 years to 12 years   = 1 week per complete year of service
12+ years             = 12 weeks (maximum)
```

### 1.4 Statutory Redundancy Pay

**2025/26 cap:** £700 per week

**Calculation by age band:**
```
Under 22              = 0.5 week per year of service
22 to 40              = 1.0 week per year of service
41 and over           = 1.5 weeks per year of service
Maximum years counted = 20
```

### 1.5 National Minimum Wage / National Living Wage

**2025/26 rates (from April 2025):**

| Age Band | Hourly Rate |
|----------|------------|
| 21 and over (National Living Wage) | £12.21 |
| 18 to 20 | £10.00 |
| Under 18 | £7.55 |
| Apprentice rate | £7.55 |
